                <p>Hello, I'm Diego Rivada, a Product Security Engineer at The Boeing Company with a Bachelor's in Science from Florida International University, 
                where I earned my degree in Computer Engineering in December 2022. Passionate about cybersecurity and embedded systems, I'm driven by the ever-evolving landscape
                of cybersecurity that shapes our digital world. I'm fascinated by the intricacies of defending against sophisticated cyber threats and developing solutions that enhance 
                security and resilience. My aspiration is to be a valuable member of dynamic teams that design and implement advanced cybersecurity measures, contributing to a safer and more secure online environment.</p>
